I had the opportunity to work in Singapore for a week, this is likely the last time I'll get to travel like this for work!

# April 19-20
Prepared for a very very long flight to Singapore, nearly 14 hours total! Didn't get much sleep on the plane :(

Knackered and starving after arriving, met up with my coworker Mikey who was also here for the week. We went to Yayoi, a japanese restaurant near our hotel. Had unagi for the first time, it's incredible. It's so much fattier and tender than I would have expected eel to be. The ordering system in the restaurant used iPads. Great! I don't need to talk to anyone to get my food!

Mikey went back to the hotel after this to rest, but I wanted to stay up as late as I could to beat the jet lag. I wandered into the nearby Mall Marina Square.

There's so so much here in Singapore that's just shopping. Marina Square is relatively small compared to the other malls I went to over the course of this trip but it's much larger than most of the shopping centres I've been to back in Dublin.

I tried a Milk Tea mcflurry since I'm weak and all the Asian McDonalds have interesting flavours, it's the only time I ever go to McDonalds. No Taro flavour though like in Hong Kong :(

I also bought a Moleskine journal in a discount section in the middle of the mall. I've wanted to get one for a while since it's something I've been wanting to try to help with my ADHD and keeping track of the random thoughts/ideas/impulses that come into my head. So far it's been helping a lot :)

On the Friday I also started a new medicine, Concerta XL, for my ADHD. It's taken me almost 9 months to get to this stage but I'm glad to finally be getting the medication I need for this. It's noticeable easier to focus and to shift my focus onto things.
