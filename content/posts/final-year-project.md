This is the full upload of my final year thesis.

For my final year project, I developed a system for monitoring and managing a plant. This involved using microcontrollers, various sensors, real time databases, and graphing solutions. In this report I cover what decisions were made and why. I also talk about the results, mistakes that were made, and potential future improvements.
