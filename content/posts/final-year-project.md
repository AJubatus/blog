With the knowledge gained from completing this project, it would be very
easy to improve on this even further. Ways this could be improved would
be using a cheap radio transmitter instead of a board with WiFi,
hopefully cutting down on power usage even further. This could involve
having numerous sensors radio back metrics to a “base” station, which
would then upload the data to the database.

A waterproof, solar-powered enclosure could be used in the system. This
would allow for easy deployment in a garden environment.

It could also be used with a home irrigation system, using metrics about
the soil to activate a solenoid for a sprinkler, this would tie in well
with the Solar Panel idea and the radio transmitter idea, allowing for
multiple remote systems independently activating sprinklers in certain
areas of a garden.
